# AI_Mafia-Machine-Learning
<h2>Details</h2>
In this repsitory, each week contains different types of algorithm of machine learning:
<h3>Week 1: </h3>
<p>In the week 1 there is no special algorithm. It contains the basic coding about Numpy and Pandas</p>

<h3>Week : </h3>
<p>In the week 2 Linear and Logistic Regression are used. This week also contains projects based on those algorihtm</p>

<h3>Week 3: </h3>
<p>In week 3 KNN algorithm is used for classification. It contains some interesting projects</p>

<h3>Week 4: </h3>
<p>Face recognition project is done by KNN classification and haarcascade xml in week 4</p>

<h3>Week 5: </h3>
<p>K means clustering is used in week 5. It contains Dominant color extraction project based on K means clustering</p>

<h2>Datasets</h2>
All the required datasets are provided for each project in each week folder

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
All these projects are very interesting, and they are done by different algorithm of machine learning. Thanks to Coding Club India for this opportunity to teach those technologies and how use those technology in different project.
